# Get your Java Microservice up and running!

This workshop demonstrates how to build a microservice with Java and how to deploy it to Kubernetes on the IBM Cloud. The microservice in this workshop is kept as simple as possible, so that it can be used as a starting point for other microservices. The microservice has been developed with Java EE and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).

*  > This workshop is available on GitHub pages (made with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)): **[Get your Java Microservice up and running!](https://ibm.github.io/get-your-java-microservice-up-and-running/)**. This version of the workshop uses a unified way to run on Mac, Linux and Windows users.

## What's a Microservice?

There are small variations of microservice definitions out there, here is one definition of [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/microservice):

* > A microservice is a service-oriented application component that is tightly scoped, strongly encapsulated, loosely coupled, independently deployable and independently scalable.
