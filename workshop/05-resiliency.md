The hands-on tasks starting in chapter [2. Hands-on tasks - Resiliency](#lab-hands-on).

# Resiliency

As stated in the [reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) cloud-native reactive applications need to be **resilient**:

> " **The system stays responsive in the face of failure.** This applies not only to highly-available, mission-critical systems – any system that is not resilient will be unresponsive after a failure. Resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation … "

In distributed systems we need to **design for failure**. For example, microservices, which invoke other microservices, must be intelligent enough to continue to work even if some of their dependencies are currently not available.

_Note:_ Here is a 3-min teaser video to the related topic: Handle microservice resiliency with MicroProfile

[![Handle microservice resiliency with MicroProfile](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JeMI7gzmdO4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeMI7gzmdO4 "Click play on youtube")

There are several different ways to build resilient service meshes with Istio, for example via **circuit breakers** ([Martin Fowler blog](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html)/[implementation](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#circuit-breakers)) and [retries](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#timeouts-and-retries).

The Istio functionality for resilient cloud-native applications is **generic** and **independent** from the implementation of the microservices. However in some cases the **handling of failures depends on the business logic** of the applications which is why this needs to be implemented in the microservices.

In **Cloud Native Starter**, the **Web app** frontend, implemented in Vue.js, displays articles. The service ‘**Web API**’ implements the **BFF** (backend for frontend) pattern. The web application accesses the ‘**Web API**’ service which invokes both the ‘articles’ and **Authors** services. The initial page of the **Web app** shows the five most recent articles including information about the authors. When we **delete** the **Authors** service inside Kubernetes, the **Web app** will still display five articles, but this time without the information about the authors, even when the **Web app** cannot display the complete information anymore. In this simple scenario it still makes sense to display the titles and links of the articles. 

| With the author service   |  When the author service is deleted|
| --- | --- |    
| ![resliency-01](images/resliency-01.png) | ![resliency-02](images/resliency-02.png) |   

The implementation of this behavior has been done in the class [Service.java](../web-api-java-jee/src/main/java/com/ibm/webapi/business/Service.java#L68). You can see the ```catch (NoConnectivity | NonexistentAuthor e)``` does handle the situation and set a default value.

```java
try {
   Author author = DataAccessManager.getAuthorsDataAccess().getAuthor(coreArticle.author);
   article.authorBlog = author.blog;
   article.authorTwitter = author.twitter;
} catch (NoConnectivity | NonexistentAuthor e) {    
   article.authorBlog = "";
   article.authorTwitter = "";
}
```

After the articles service is deleted, we will notice that the same 5 articles are displayed when we refresh the browser. That’s because in this trivial scenario the ‘**Web API**’ service **caches** the last read articles. If the ‘articles’ service is not available it simply returns the information from the cache.

|  When the author service is deleted   |   When the author and articles service is deleted |
| --- | --- |    
| ![resliency-02](images/resliency-02.png) | ![resliency-02](images/resliency-02.png) | 

We are using the [Eclipse MicroProfile fallback annotation](https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-fallback.html). In this case a fallback method is invoked if the original method throws an exception. Here we have the two operations inside the [service.java](../web-api-java-jee/src/main/java/com/ibm/webapi/business/Service.java#L45).

* The definition of the fallback profile **@Fallback**

```java
@Fallback(fallbackMethod = "fallbackNoArticlesService")
public List<Article> getArticles() throws NoDataAccess {
   List<CoreArticle> coreArticles = new ArrayList<CoreArticle>();   
   try {
      coreArticles = DataAccessManager.getArticlesDataAccess().getArticles(5);                          
   } catch (NoConnectivity e) {
      System.err.println("com.ibm.webapi.business.getArticles: Cannot connect to articles service");
      throw new NoDataAccess(e);
   }
...
} 
```

* The implementation of the fallback profile. Here we create a list with the last shown articles ```lastReadArticles = new ArrayList<Article>();```.

```java
...
public List<Article> fallbackNoArticlesService() {
   System.err.println("com.ibm.webapi.business.fallbackNoArticlesService: Cannot connect to articles service");
   if (lastReadArticles == null) lastReadArticles = new ArrayList<Article>();
      return lastReadArticles;
}
```

## 2. Hands-on tasks - Resiliency <a name="lab-hands-on"></a>

Resiliency is part of the code: if an API call is not answered because of an error ar a timeout, the business logic must have a implementation of a fallback.

### 2.1 Gain access to your cluster

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account. Include the --sso option if using a federated ID.

   ```sh
   $ ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com -r us-south -g default
   ```
   
   _Note:_ If this statement does not work, please change **d**efault to **D**efault

2. Download the kubeconfig files for your cluster.

   ```sh
   $ ibmcloud ks cluster-config --cluster cloud-native
   ```

3. Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable. Copy the output from the previous command and paste it in your terminal. The command output looks similar to the following example:

   ```sh
   $ export KUBECONFIG=/Users/$USER/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/hands-on-verification/kube-config-mil01-cloud-native.yml
   ```

4. Verify that you can connect to your cluster by listing your worker nodes.

   ```sh
   $ kubectl get nodes
   ```

---

### 2.2 Setup and test the resiliency

In the following bash scripts we use **ibmcloud** and **kubectl** commands to interact with IBM Cloud, IBM Container Registry Service and the IBM Kubernetes service in IBM Cloud. With **sed** and **awk** we extract the output from the comandline.

1. In order to demonstrate resiliency run the following commands to create a working set of services:

   ```sh
   $ ./iks-scripts/check-prerequisites.sh
   $ ./scripts/delete-all.sh
   $ ./iks-scripts/deploy-articles-java-jee.sh
   $ ./iks-scripts/deploy-web-api-java-jee.sh
   $ ./iks-scripts/deploy-authors-nodejs.sh
   $ ./iks-scripts/deploy-web-app-vuejs.sh
   $ ./scripts/deploy-istio-ingress-v1.sh
   $ ./iks-scripts/show-urls.sh
   ```

2. Open the **Web APP** in a new browser tab: http://YOUR_IP:31092/

_Note:_ You get this link as output of the ```iks-scripts/show-urls.sh``` script.

   ![cns-container-web-app-04](images/cns-container-web-app-05.png)

2. Delete the **Authors** service

   ```sh
   $ ./scripts/delete-authors-nodejs.sh
   ```

   Refresh the browser and verify the remaining information. The details for the author are no longer avaiable. 

   ![resliency-02](images/resliency-02.png)

3. Delete the **articles** service

   ```sh
   $ ./scripts/delete-articles-java-jee.sh
   ```

   Refresh the browser and verify the remaining information. Although the articles service is gone, title and author are still displayed because the fallback method displays a cached version.

Now, we've finished the **Resiliency**.

**Congratulations** :thumbsup:, you have finished :checkered_flag: this **hands-on workshop** :-).

_Note:_ If you want to do more, you can move on with the [optional Lab - Replace the Node.js Authors microservice with a simple Java implementation](06-java-development.md).
